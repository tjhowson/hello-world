# hello-world

Late blooming coding adventurer. Always had an interest since days of DOS and my apple C2+.  I remember the days when IRC first hit the seen, then became MIRC. I have made several websites in a hobby like fashion and want to develop into a quasi professional. Would really like to learn about pen testing and find be a bug merc on the side.
